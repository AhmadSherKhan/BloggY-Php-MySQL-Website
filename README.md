# BloggY-Php-MySQL-Website
Created a blog website using Php and MySQL that allows users to post their own blog entries and upload a
thumbnail image along with their blog post. They can also select a category for their post from a list of
pre-defined categories, and the website includes a dashboard where users can view and manage their
posts. To ensure the security of the website validation and authentication are done.
‚óè I also created an admin panel where an admin can manage the list of categories. The admin is able to add,
edit, and delete categories as needed.
